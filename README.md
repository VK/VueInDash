# VueInDash

Sometimes GUI elements in Plotly Dash can get a little unmanageable, because of the needed
callback structure. 

One solution: If parts of a GUI become too complicated to be created with callbacks, simply keep the
callbacks for the data creation and build the GUI with all reactive features of Vue.
